# Customise The Wizard

Give your new users a quick tour that _you_ control — all through simple Markdown\
files. No coding required.

***

## 1 · Where do I put my pages?

```
wizard\_steps/
│
├─ plex/        ← steps that appear when your server type is Plex
│   ├─ 01\_download.md
│   ├─ 02\_intro.md
│   └─ 99\_tips.md
│
└─ jellyfin/    ← steps for Jellyfin
├─ 01\_download.md
└─ 99\_tips.md

```

* **Pick the folder** (`plex` or `jellyfin`).
* **Create a new `.md` file** for every step.
* The files are shown in _alphabetical_ order, so a handy trick is to start\
  filenames with numbers: `01_`, `02_`, `03_` …

***

### 2 · Writing a step (now with **title** and **require**)

Each Markdown file may start with an **optional** YAML front-matter block:

```yaml
---
title: Download the Plex app      # overrides the first heading if you prefer
require: true                     # user must click a button or link on this
---
```

* **`title`**\
  – If present, this value is used as the card heading.\
  – If omitted, the wizard falls back to the first `# Heading` it finds.
* **`require`**\
  – When set to `true`, the _Next_ button stays disabled until the user clicks**any** link or button inside that card.\
  – Perfect for slides that say “Please download the app before continuing”.

After the front-matter you write normal Markdown as before:

```markdown
We recommend installing the **native Plex app** for the best picture quality.

[Download for my device](https://www.plex.tv/media-server-downloads/#plex-app){:target="_blank" .btn}
```

Everything else about ordering, previewing, dark-mode support, etc. stays\
exactly the same.

```markdown
# Download the Plex app

You’ll get the best experience by installing the **native Plex app** on the
device you’re using right now.

[Download for my device](https://www.plex.tv/media-server-downloads/#plex-app){:target="_blank" .btn}
```

* **Headings** (`#`, `##`, `###`, …) automatically get nice sizes & colours.
* **Links / buttons** – add Tailwind classes with the `{:.btn}` notation\
  and `{:target="_blank"}` if you want it to open in a new tab.
* **Images** – just use normal Markdown:`![Alt text](<link>){.mx-auto .max-w-xs}`\
  (classes after the brace are optional).

> **Tip:** dark-mode is handled automatically; you don’t have to style anything.

## 3 · Previewing your changes

1. Save the file in _wizard\_steps/…_
2. Restart the app (or refresh if you’re running with live-reload).
3. Navigate to /wizard ➜ the wizard shows your new page in sequence.

Nothing to compile, nothing to rebuild — it “just works”.

***

## 4 · Removing or re-ordering pages

* **Re-order** — rename the files so they sort the way you want\
  (`01_hello.md`, `02_getting-started.md`, …).
* **Remove** — simply delete the file.\
  The wizard skips anything that isn’t there.

## 5 · FAQ

| Question                             | Answer                                                                                       |
| ------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| _Can I disable the wizard entirely?_ | Delete every file in `wizard_steps/plex/` and `wizard_steps/jellyfin/`.                      |
| _Do I need to know Tailwind?_        | No — plain Markdown is enough. Add classes only if you want fancy buttons or centred images. |
